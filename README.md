# Train Your Brain
With Train-Your-Brain you can easily train yourself on knowledge and facts you really want to remember. Add some questions and the correct answers and try to remember those facts. If you remembered the answer, validate your solution with what you initially set as the answer.
This is an ideal companion for every student who is trying to get the hang on their subject.
